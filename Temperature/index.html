    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Decision Trees are an important type of algorithm for predictive modeling machine learning. They also serve as a
        great way to take apart a decision and represent it with only the most important factors.</p>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div style="width: fit-content;">
            <div class="tree fixed">
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#"><b>Node</b></a>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="#">Leaf</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#">Leaf</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>When modeling a decision tree, you are making a binary tree. In the tree each <b>node</b> represents a
                single input variable and a split point on that variable and the leaves represent the final decision to
                be made as a result.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div>
            <p>In the most basic of cases a decision would be made based on a single value, or node. An example of this
                could be whether or not to consider an individual an adult. In this case if an individual is above the
                age 18 then they are an adult, otherwise they are not.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="width: fit-content;">
            <div class="tree fixed">
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#"><b>Age &gt;= 18 ?</b></a>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="#">Yes</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#">No</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The <b>leaf</b> nodes of the tree contain an output variable, which is used to make a prediction. Predictions are
        made by walking the splits of the tree until arriving at a leaf node and output the class value at that leaf
        node.</p>
    <p>Trees are fast to learn and very fast for making predictions. They are also often accurate for a broad range of
        problems and do not require any special preparation for your data.</p>

<div id="library-introduction" class="hidden">
    <h2>Decision tree in action</h2>
    <p>As with most things related to machine learning, there is a rather large community working to create libraries
        and tools that make it easier to use different algorithms. The impact of this is that all you likely just need
        to make the choice about the problem you're going to solve and the algorithm you're interested in using.</p>
    <p>For this tutorial on Decision Tree we're going to be using a library created by the user Lagoduik on Github,
        <a href="https://github.com/lagodiuk/decision-tree-js/" target="_blank">it can be found here</a>. We will be
        covering all of the code that goes into this tutorial and its different impacts on the resulting system.
        Lagoduik does provide some demos for how to use their library as well, so if you'd like to see additional
        examples make sure to check them out. </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>We've all probably been in the situation where we've looked out the window and have seen clouds on the
                horizon or snow already coming down. The problem we're going to be tackling with our decision tree is,
                <b>knowing the current temperature and weather, should I wear a coat?</b></p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div id="problem-introduction" class="hidden">
    <h2>Setting up</h2>
    <p>Now that we have a problem and a tool selected we need to create some training data for our system.
        <b>Training data</b>, refers to the initial set of information that our system will rely on in order to
        make its decisions. The more training data we provide to the decision tree the more accurate our results will
        be.
    </p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
const SUN = "Sun";
const RAIN = "Rain";
const SNOW = "Snow";

const NONE = "None";
const LIGHT = "Light coat";
const HEAVY = "Heavy coat";

let trainingData =[
    {weather: SUN, temperature: 70, coat: NONE},
    {weather: SUN, temperature: 40, coat: LIGHT},
    {weather: SUN, temperature: 7, coat: HEAVY}
];</pre>
    <p>First we establish a set of variables so that when we make comparisons we can refer to the variable. With these
        variables and our training data we create the basis of the language that our decision tree will use.</p>
    <p><b>Unfortunately</b>, if we use the training data as it is in the above snippet we do not provide a great basis
        for our decision tree. This is because we do not include "Rain" or "Snow" in the data, which could cause our
        system to give us incorrect recommendations when it comes to what type of coat we should wear when that type of
        weather appears.</p>
    <p>Instead, we will use the following set of training data which is quite complete considering the problem we are
        tackling.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
let trainingData = [
    {weather: SUN, temperature: 70, coat: NONE},
    {weather: SUN, temperature: 65, coat: NONE},
    {weather: SUN, temperature: 40, coat: LIGHT},
    {weather: SUN, temperature: 15, coat: HEAVY},
    {weather: SUN, temperature: 7, coat: HEAVY},

    {weather: RAIN, temperature: 75, coat: LIGHT},
    {weather: RAIN, temperature: 67, coat: LIGHT},
    {weather: RAIN, temperature: 58, coat: LIGHT},
    {weather: RAIN, temperature: 52, coat: LIGHT},
    {weather: RAIN, temperature: 42, coat: LIGHT},
    {weather: RAIN, temperature: 27, coat: HEAVY},
    {weather: RAIN, temperature: 15, coat: HEAVY},

    {weather: SNOW, temperature: 32, coat: HEAVY},
    {weather: SNOW, temperature: 21, coat: HEAVY},
    {weather: SNOW, temperature: 14, coat: HEAVY},
    {weather: SNOW, temperature: 3, coat: HEAVY}
];</pre>
</div>

<div id="create-tree" class="hidden">
    <h2>Creating the decision tree with the library</h2>

    <p>Now that we have our training data we are able to make the decision tree easily using the library. Here is the
        code snippet that sets up the decision tree so that it can be used.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
let config = {
    trainingSet: trainingData,
    categoryAttr: 'coat',
};
var decisionTree = new dt.DecisionTree(config);</pre>

    <p>Now that the decision tree has been setup we can utilize it to make predictions about the question we designed
        our data around. <strong>Do we need a coat with today's weather?</strong> To make predictions we call the
        'predict' method on our decision tree and give an object with weather and temperature parameters.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
decisionTree.predict({weather: "Sun", temperature: 28})</pre>
    <p>You can try this now in the browser console as well by entering the command above. You can also try changing
        "Sun" to "Snow" or the temperature value to another. The result returned is determined by the decision tree.

<div id="evaluate-tree" class="hidden">
    <h2>Evaluating the System</h2>
    <p>We went through this process to be able to answer a question, <b>Do I need a coat?</b> In order to decide if our
        system is accurate we need to be able to evaluate it. For our evaluation we're going to define certain
        boundaries.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>When it is over 60&deg;, you do not need a coat.</li>
        <li>As long as it is above 30&deg; and not snowing, you can wear a light coat.</li>
        <li>When it is below 30&deg; or snowing, you need a heavy coat.</li>
        <li>If it is raining you will at least need a light coat.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are definitely many more factors to consider in the real world if we wanted to answer this question in the
        most complete fashion, but this is a good starting point.</p>

    <p>With these evaluation rules in mind we can create an evaluation function. This way we can check how accurate each
        our decision tree is within the scope of our problem. Checkout <a href="evaluate.js" target="_blank">evaluate.js</a>
        if you want to see the whole method, it is named "evaluateTestPoint".</p>

    <p>Now to find the accuracy of our decision tree, we need to take our evaluation method and run it hundreds of times
        with different test points. This will give us a substantial amount of evidence to support our resulting level of
        accuracy.</p>

    <p>If you at <a href="evaluate.js" target="_blank">evaluate.js</a> you will see a method called 'evaluateTree' where
        we can provide a decision tree and a loop runs. The loop generates a random test point and then evaluates it
        against our decision tree to find the accuracy of the prediction. Since these test points are random the outcome
        resulting average of the accuracy can change slightly, but as you can see since we have a good set of training
        data we have relatively high accuracy, in relation to our evaluation rules.</p>

    <p>Now that we've made one tree and know how to use it. Let's take a look into how the training data can affect
        the decision tree we make. First here is the training data that we already used when creating </p>
